# MunchMate
MunchMate is a Discord bot that we made during NewHacks 2023. The bot's main function to gather data on the food available at the Chestnut Resident Dining Hall and based on the user's preference, give them a list of different foods that they should eat. 

The bot uses an algorithm that considers calories, saturated fat, sugar, protein, and carbohydrates.

# !food + prference_number

The preference number should be from 0 - 10, with 0 representing that you would like to lost the most weight, 5 respresenting that you would like to maintain weight, and 10 representing that you would like to gain the most weight.
